# Creating a minecraft server
[Minecraft](https://minecraft.com) is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work of art – the choice is all yours.


## Requirements
- 2-4GB VPS Minimum
- Root and SSH Access
- Basic linux understanding

## Getting started

1. Installing required packages
```bash
sudo apt -y install sudo screen wget openjdk-18-jdk
```

2. Making the folder and going in

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We are going to name the folder `my-server`, you can name whatever you want to.
</Callout>

```bash
sudo mkdir my-server && my-server
```

3. Agreeing to Minecraft EULA
```bash
sudo echo "eula=true" > eula.txt
```

4. Getting the jar file

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Please make sure to replace `<link>` with the correct URL.
</Callout>

```bash
sudo wget <link>
```

In this case we're going to use the vanilla jar
```bash
sudo wget https://piston-data.mojang.com/v1/objects/8dd1a28015f51b1803213892b50b7b4fc76e594d/server.jar
```

5. Enter on a screen shell
```bash
screen -S minecraft
```

6. Starting up the minecraft server
```bash
java -jar server.jar
```

Now press `Ctrl`, `a`, `n` on your keyboard. To get out of the screen shell & run the minecraft server on the background.

7. Connect and enjoy!
